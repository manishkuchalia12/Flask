    "Advantages \n",
    "1.Flask is unopinionated, meaning it doesn't impose a specific way of doing things. Developers have the freedom to choose the libraries and tools they prefer for tasks like database integration, authentication, and form handling.\n",
    "2. Flask is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a minimalistic design that allows developers to get started quickly and only use what is necessary for their application.\n",

    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "Ans:- app routing refers to the process of defining URL patterns (routes) that map to specific functions (view functions) in your application. These routes determine how the application responds to different HTTP requests. The @app.route decorator is commonly used for defining routes in Flask.\n",
    "Why do we use app routes in Flask?\r",
    "\r\n",
    "Organizing Code: App routes help organize your code by associating specific functionalities with distinct URL patterns. This makes your application modular and easier to maintain\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Separation of Concerns: Flask follows the principle of separation of concerns, and app routes contribute to this by separating different parts of your application logic based on their functionalites.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "URL Structure: App routes allow you to define a logical and meaningful URL structure for your web application, making it more user-friendly and understandable."
